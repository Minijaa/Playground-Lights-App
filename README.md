# Playground-Lights-App
Frontend for a University project called Stockholm LjusKul. Written in TypeScript using the Ionic Framework.

LjusKul is a set of light-based games that utilise lamp-posts in various parks in Stockholm. A mobile application enables game selection and control, as well as providing social connectivity.

The intended users are families living in or visiting Stockholm. The app utilises sensors (virtual sensors atm) in the lamp-posts to measure the number of visitors that are in the area. The data is then used to display park activity (as well as general information and map location) in the app, helping users choose a suitable park for their visit. There is also an option to see if friends (who are also using the app) are in any parks.

The games are suitable for children aged 3-8. Various sequences of colours create different challenges, e.g. chase or avoid a certain colour. Difficulty level may be set in the app. The app also features a short description of each game, which might especially be useful for new users.
